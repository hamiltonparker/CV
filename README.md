About Me
---------

2016-2020 (expected)
:   **Bachelors Physics**; Brigham Young University (Provo)  

I am an undergradute at Brigham Young Universtiy studying Physics. I have been part of the Material Simulation Grop since my freshmen year in 2016. Since then I have deloped skills in C++ and Python as well as good coding practices such as continual integration and code coverage for unit testing. I have also gained experience working in teams to complete projects.

Programming Experience
-----------------------
|Language|Experience|Usage                         |
|--------|----------|------------------------------|
|Python  |1.5 years |BYU materials simulation group|
|C++     |2 years   |BYU courses                   |

I also have experience using linux based systems and command line interfaces

Projects
------------
#### Symmetry Preserving Integragtion Grids:

My current work is in support of our symmertry preserving integration grid project. Generating supercells that manitain the symmertry of the parent crystal lattice. These supercells are used as the integration grids for reciprocal bruillouin zone integrations to calculate crystal system energies and enthalpies. This preservation of symmetry allows for symmetry folding in the integration process.
